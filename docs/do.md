# do

## What it does

`do` matches a request to one **Playbook** and runs its steps: a **Ticket**'s path or issue
reference builds that Ticket as the last step of the chain, a request in words runs outside it, and
a request that fits no Playbook is sent to the door that owns it in one message. Four Playbooks
exist and one run reads one of them: `ticket`, `trivial`, `bug-fix`, `refactoring`. Every reply
opens with the Playbook it matched, so a wrong match costs you one retyped request and nothing
else.

The run never lands its own work and never fixes what a review found. It builds in a git worktree
of its own, one behaviour per green commit, runs the gate, and hands the branch to
[do-code-review](do-code-review.md), which fixes the Findings it marked `Act on` and fast-forwards
your branch when the **Review** is Green. Your branch takes reviewed commits or none. Nothing is
pushed: the run ends on the `git push` for you to type.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/do <request>`, and the agent won't reach for it on its own.

| Ask | Use |
|---|---|
| build one ticket the chain cut | `/do <the Ticket's path>`, or `/do <issue number or URL>` where the project has a tracker file |
| fix a bug nobody wrote a ticket for | `/do <the bug in words>`: what happened, where, and the error or the wrong output |
| a typo, a doc line, a log wording, a rename inside one file | `/do <the change in words>` |
| reshape code whose behaviour stays where it is | `/do <the reshape in words>`: refactor, rename, extract, inline, dedupe, move a module |
| build a whole spec | not this skill: [tickets](tickets.md) cuts the spec first, and `do` takes one ticket of the cut |
| decide the plan, or a feature with no ticket | [discuss](discuss.md), or [spec](spec.md) when the conversation already holds the discussion |
| understand code rather than change it | `/how` for the mechanism, `/why` for the rationale, `/teach` to follow it end to end |

One request, one Playbook. `do` takes a single ticket and never a spec, and it never batches two
tickets into one run. Answers arrive in the language you opened the session in; everything written
into the project is in English.

## Prerequisites

Nothing has to be installed for `do` to run, but four things in the project change what a run can
do, and the first message says which of them it found.

| In the project | What `do` does with it, and without it |
|---|---|
| the **Ticket** itself, a file under `.scratch/` or an issue on the tracker `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` describes | the `ticket` Playbook's whole input. No file and no tracker entry, and there is nothing to match: a bare issue number is refused and the ticket's path is asked for |
| a Testing Policy with its unit test author at `.claude/agents/unit-test-author.md` | the first message reads `Loop: policy` and every new test is written by that author. Without it the line reads `Loop: fallback` and the run writes each failing test itself, red before the fix either way |
| [do-code-review](do-code-review.md) linked in the session | the review fixes its `Act on` Findings and lands the branch. Without it the step reads `skip: do-code-review not listed`, nothing lands, and the reply hands you the worktree, its branch and the review to run yourself |
| the vendored `architect`, `how` and `unslop` | the shape is sketched before a boundary is crossed, the grounding stays out of the run's context window, and the reply is cleaned up. Each is optional and each step says in one line what it does instead |

The run writes into two places outside your branch: the worktree at `.claude/worktrees/do-<slug>`,
excluded through this clone's `.git/info/exclude` and never through the project's `.gitignore`, and
the Ticket file in the **Main checkout**, which the run edits and never commits. Installing every
skill named here is the same procedure, and [the top-level README](../README.md) carries it once.

## The Playbook

A **Playbook** is one execution model, one file in the skill's `references/` folder, read only when
the router matches it. The skill file itself holds the router, the rules that apply to every run,
and the links, so a run loads one Playbook and never the other three
([ADR 0008](adr/0008-do-is-a-router-and-only-its-ticket-playbook-is-inside-the-chain.md)). Only
`ticket` is inside the chain; the other three exist for work that never entered it.

| Playbook | Matched by | What the run does |
|---|---|---|
| `ticket` | a Ticket's path, or an issue reference the tracker file resolves | claims the Ticket in your checkout, builds it in a worktree behaviour by behaviour, gates, reviews, runs the affected flows, and closes the Ticket with the evidence quoted under it |
| `bug-fix` | a defect in words: what happened, where, and the error or the wrong output | reproduces it on the surface it happens on, rules hypotheses out with runtime evidence, commits the failing reproduction before the smallest fix, and verifies on that same surface |
| `refactoring` | a reshape in words whose behaviour stays where it is | pins the behaviour before any structure moves, then commits subtraction, reshape and cleanup in that order, so one revert undoes one slice |
| `trivial` | a change no test could tell before from after | edits in place on your branch, runs the suite that covers the touched files, and lands one commit. No worktree, no review, one message |

## The door a request goes to

A request that matches no Playbook ends the run in one message: the door that owns it and the
command to type, with nothing written and no Playbook file read.

| The request | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| a spec | `/tickets <spec>`, or `/journey <spec>` first when the spec's verdict reads `required` |
| a pasted session summary | `/spec`, since the discussion already happened |
| a feature, or anything else with no ticket | `/discuss`, or `/spec` when the conversation already holds the discussion |
| how something works, or why it was built that way | `/how`, `/why`, `/teach` |
| a sketch, a layout, a variant to try | `/prototype` |
| an issue number where the project has no tracker file | back to you, for the ticket's path. The number is never guessed against a list in the conversation |

A Playbook has its own door on top of that one, and `trivial` is where it bites. **Trivial** is
judged by structure and never by size, twice: on the request before any edit, and on the diff before
the commit, the second time by a script a reviewer can rerun
([ADR 0010](adr/0010-the-trivial-playbook-takes-only-a-behaviour-preserving-change-judged-by-structure.md)).
A one-character "typo" inside a string the code reads at runtime is a defect, so it leaves for
`bug-fix` and gets a failing test first. A rename that adds or changes an export is a reshape, so it
leaves for `refactoring`. A fifty-line comment sweep stays Trivial. When the diff check fires after
the edit, the touched files are restored and nothing is committed.

## One behaviour, one green commit

The three Playbooks that build share one loop, so the discipline is the same whether the work came
through the chain or not. The run creates a worktree from your current HEAD, writes the list of
behaviours from the Ticket and its spec rather than from the implementation, and takes them one at a
time: a failing test first with its expected red stated, the smallest change that turns it green, a
refactor on green, then one commit holding the test and the code. Each commit body carries its
`Behaviour:` line, which is how a second `/do` on the same Ticket reads the run off the branch and
picks up at the first behaviour with no commit beside it instead of starting over.

The gate runs after the last edit and never before it, because "it passed earlier" is stale. Then
the branch goes to the review, the affected flows run from your checkout, and the Ticket is closed
with the command lines and their output quoted under `## Evidence`. A run that stops for any reason
leaves the worktree and its branch in place and names both, so nothing is half landed and nothing is
lost.

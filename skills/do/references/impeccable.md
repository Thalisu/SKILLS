# The impeccable fork

The fork that builds one Front-end ticket of a Spec reading `Front-end: impeccable`, in the worktree
the session cut, per
[ADR 0078](../../../docs/adr/0078-an-impeccable-front-end-ticket-forks-no-planner-and-do-impeccable-stands-in-for-the-builder.md).
It is the `do-impeccable` agent `do` ships in [do-impeccable.md](../agents/do-impeccable.md), forked
by the build step of [ticket.md](ticket.md) in the Builder's place and by nobody else, one layer
below the session. No Planner runs ahead of it and no Plan exists: the Ticket's acceptance criteria
are its work list.

This file is the session's: it fills the brief from it and routes the return by it. The fork never
opens it, since its brief names no repository root to open it from, and reads its standing rules
in its own definition.

## The brief

The fork is dispatched with these two keys and nothing else:

```
Ticket: <the absolute path in the main checkout, or the tracker reference>
Worktree: <the absolute path of the worktree root the build runs in>
```

The keys are written here and in no second place, the rule [builder.md](builder.md) holds for the
Builder's own. The brief has no key for where the return goes: the return is the fork's final
message, so nothing is written for it, in the worktree or outside it. It carries no rule either.
What the fork loads, where it may write, how it commits and what it returns are the same on every
run, so they live in the definition, where a brief composed on one run cannot drop one of them.

The brief is the same on the first fork and on every re-fork. Nothing in it says where to pick up:
a fork dispatched again reads the `Behaviour:` lines off the branch and carries on from the first
criterion that has none.
